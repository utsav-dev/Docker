# Def 
Docker-Image: Executable application artifact [package].
             Simialr to a JAR file but it includes the code as well as the config & env info as well.
             Add even env varibles in the files/ directories.

Docker-Container: Running instance of an Docker-image.
Docker-Hub: Registery for the docker images[default]                
                        


# Docker Commands
docker images - list of images on the machine.
docker ps - list of running containers.
docker pull {image}:{tag} [default tag is latest in case the tag is missing in the cmd].
docker run {image}:{tag}

NOTE: above cmd will print all the logs of the application running in the container and blocks your termial.
      in order to mitigate from this behavior use below cmd.

docker run -d {image}:{tag} - it will detach [-d] and runs the container in the bkg and id is printed.
docker logs {container id}

NOTE: directly run an image which is not pulled already on your local.
      docker run {image}:{tag}
this will first pull then run this image.

docker stop {container id}


# Port Binding
-App inside container runs in an isolated docker network.
so we need to expose the container port to the host(m/c on which it runs).

docker run -d -p {host port}:{container port}{image}:{tag}     - p means publish the container port to host port.

Note - Standard Practice is to bind the host port to same container port.



# Container Start and Stop
Every time we use the run cmd docker starts a new container w/o reusing the prev one.



# Alaise for the container instead of id or the provided name
docker run --name web-app -d  {image_id}


# Private Registeries [AWS-ECR][Nexus][Docker-Gub]

# Registry vs Repository
AWS-PCR is a registry inside which there can be multiple repository for your application [1-1]
in each app repo many versions of the same app can be stored.


# Dockerize - Creating a docker file

1. Create a definition of how to build an image from our app.
2. The above def is stored in a file called "Docker-file"
3. Docker-file is text doc in which inst are given to assemble an img.
4. Docker can then build the image by those instr
