#Def 
Docker-Image: Executable application artifact [package].
             Simialr to a JAR file but it includes the code as well as the config & env info as well.
             Add even env varibles in the files/ directories.

Docker-Container: Running instance of an Docker-image.
Docker-Hub: Registery for the docker images[default]                
                        


#Docker Commands
docker images - list of images on the machine.
docker ps - list of running containers.
docker pull {image}:{tag} [default tag is latest in case the tag is missing in the cmd].
docker run {image}:{tag}

NOTE: above cmd will print all the logs of the application running in the container and blocks your termial.
      in order to mitigate from this behavior use below cmd.

docker run -d {image}:{tag} - it will detach [-d] and runs the container in the bkg and id is printed.
docker logs {container id}

NOTE: directly run an image which is not pulled already on your local.
      docker run {image}:{tag}
this will first pull then run this image.

docker stop {container id}

docker run -d -p {host port}:{container port}{image}:{tag}     - p means publish the container port to host port.
